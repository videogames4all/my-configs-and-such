# my-configs-and-such
I put some configs and other miscellaneous files here!

You see, one night, I thought to myself.
I said, "Andrew, why don't you put your config files, scripts, and playlists that you use regularly on a repository since it's 2016."

Then I told myself "Why not."

So here I am.

Also if you wanna nab some of these, do it.
