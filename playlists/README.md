If you're gonna nab these, you'll probably want to know you'll have to change a lot of it.

It's really here so I have a backup.

I hope I don't lose any of this music.

I frickin' love all this music.

I should make more playlists.

I should stop my ranting.

"Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah (raspberry, raspberry) blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah."

Long live Rock 'n' Roll, may the master bluesmen practice their craft forever.
